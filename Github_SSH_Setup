On Ubuntu CLI:

FIRST: Run the following command to see if existing SSH keys are present:
ls -al ~/.ssh

1. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

2. eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

3. ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

4. cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard


( If xclip isn't installed (common in some Linux distributions), you may need to install it or simply open the file and copy its contents manually.

Go to GitHub and navigate to your account settings.

Click on "SSH and GPG keys" in the sidebar, then click on the "New SSH key" button.

Paste your key into the "Key" field and add a descriptive title.

Click "Add SSH key." )

5. ssh -T git@github.com

Then to clone a (private) repo to your CLI via SSH:
git clone git@github.com:user/private_repo.git

Create or Activate Minconda for version control

cd into root file of repo that contains setup.py:
pip install -e .
