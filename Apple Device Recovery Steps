- Steps for each Iphone type to erase & restore the OS.

*Ipad Edition*

Fairly simple steps, can be difficult to find a straight answer online.

1. Charge your Ipad.

2. Download Itunes on your (MAC or Winndows) computer, no need to log in or create an account.
- Itunes her is basically an interface to facilitate the device's connection to Apple's servers for the restoration process.

3.Next we will enter DFU (Device Firmware Update) Mode, this is a more intensive restore than standard recovery mode.
  *Note steps vary slightly depending on your device Hardware (home button, etc.)

4. With Itunes running, turn off Ipad and plug into computer.

5. Enter DFU: Press and hold Power Button for 3 seconds
  - Before releasing Power Button, press and hold Home Button for 10 seconds, then release Power Button

6. Continue to hold Home Button until Itunes detects Ipad in Recovery Mode

7. In Itunes a Restore Button should pop up, press it, and let it do its magic.

(May take a couple of tries, if so: Restart Ipad and hold power / home buttons for the prescribed times above)

Bam!
