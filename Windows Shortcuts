Below is the process for creating a shortcut (hotkeys) via your Windows Desktop.
The below workflow will enable a hotkey to shutdown your machine.

Right click on Desktop, select:
'New'>'Shortcut'

In the location field type:
shutdown.exe /s /t 0         ### /s is shutdown, /t 0 sets delay to zero seconds

Hit Next & give your Shortcut a name.

Now go to the new icon on your desktop, right click and go to Properties >> Shortcut, to set shortcut key:
CTRL ALT M

In that same section you can also change the Icon from a small list of images.
