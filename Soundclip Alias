A quick guide to activate an audio file 'soundclip' with just one press of a button from within a linux terminal.


1. Download sound clip, and install ffmpeg and aplay on your linux OS via: 
sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo apt install alsa-utils

2. Go to Downloads folder, change file (.mp4 doesn't work well with aplay) to .wav format via:
ffmpeg -i inputsound.mp4 soundclip.wav

3. Create Directory for Soundclips, cd into it, & create bash script: nano SOUND.sh
#!/bin/bash

zound='/home/Downloads/soundclip.wav'      ###Might need to check the path of the file, via: realpath soundclip.wav 

if [ -f "$zound" ]; then
        aplay "$zound"
else
        echo 'an erie silence $zound'
fi


4. Save and Exit

5. chmod +x SOUND.sh

6. Open ~/.bashrc file in text editor, scroll to the bottom, & create a Path to assign a Soundclip Alias, via:
nano ~/.bashrc
alias q='/home/soundalias/SOUND.sh'
