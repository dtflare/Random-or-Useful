Use below code as a tool in linux terminal to decode or encode files, text, etc., in base64

EXAMPLE USAGE:
Encode:
encode sample.txt > encoded-sample.txt
Decode:
decode encoded-sample.txt


Encode (code for bash file):
#!/bin/bash


if [ -f "$1" ]; then
	base64 "$1"
elif [ -n "$1" ]; then
	echo -n "$1" | base64
else
    echo "that is a NOGO" >&2
    exit 1
fi

Decode (code for bash file):
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the input is a file
if [ -f "$1" ]; then
    # Decode the Base64 contents of the file
    base64 --decode "$1"
elif [ -n "$1" ]; then
    # Decode the provided Base64 string
    echo -n "$1" | base64 --decode
else
    echo "No input provided" >&2
    exit 1
fi
