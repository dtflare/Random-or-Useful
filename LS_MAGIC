Follow the steps below to setup << ls -dt $PWD/* | tac >> as an Environment variable.
    - Enables a list with full paths of all files in current or requested directory - in descending order!

Why? - Often it's the most recently modified / saved file that we're after in the Command Line, this conveniently lists that file right above your text prompt in a Linux Terminal.

1. Create a bash script with nano
nano LS_MAGIC

2. Copy / Paste the following:
#!/bin/bash

# Set directory to the first argument, or to the current directory if no argument is given
directory="${1:-$PWD}"

# List files in the specified (or current) directory in reverse order with full paths
ls -dt "$directory"/* | tac

3. Save & Exit then add executable priviledge
CTRL X

chmod +x LS_MAGIC

4. Add to path

mv ./LS_MAGIC /usr/bin/LS_MAGIC

5. Test! 

While in your Downloads folder try: LS_MAGIC

While in your Downloads folder list home directory contents: LS_MAGIC ~


Bam!
