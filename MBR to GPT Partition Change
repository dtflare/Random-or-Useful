This is a walkthrough on turning an active Linux device into a Windows OS.
Irrelevant if a CMOS reset can be applied, and/or total wipe / fresh hardware components.
Otherwise, for devices which may be designed for Linux / have Linux already installed with an MBR partition scheme, this shows the steps to get from A to B.


The Most Random-or-Useful tidbit: Tiny11: a 'bloat-free' fully operational Windows OS, developed by NETDEV, runs on only 3.6GB. Try it out!

1. Open terminal on you rlinux device, and install gdisk
sudo apt install gdisk

2.Enumerate your drives and locate the correct name, look for ssd storage (likely the largest one)
lsblk

3. Run, replace 'sda1' w/ the main drive (will represent your ssd storage in lsblk output
sudo gdisk /dev/sda1

4. Once in gdisk follow the below steps to convert from MBR to GPT. <Enter> = Press Enter Key.
r <Enter>
w <Enter>

5. Check if it was successful
sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda1

6. If it says 'GPT: Damaged' follow steps 7-8
  - Can also check via:
    sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda1
  - Also with: (if it says ext 4 = MBR partition, if vfat = GPT)

7. Run gdisk again:
sudo gdisk /dev/sda1

8. Follow below steps
r <Enter>
v <Enter>
e <Enter>
b <Enter>
c <Enter>
w <Enter>
q <Enter>

9. Shutdown device, and install Live Bootable, in this case we are using Tiny11, 3.6GB Windows OS by NETDEV, built w/ as little bloatware as possible.

10. Once you Enter in language, and hit the checkmark to Accept some T&C's you will be brought to a page with your partitions.

11. Select /dev/sda1 (whichever partition you were working on)
Press Delete
Press New

12. Now you will be able to Press Next, and have a successful install.
- Notice the Partition Scheme Changes to MSR (Microsoft Reserved Partition), but without first changing it with this method from MBR to GPT this would not be possible.

Bam!
