Miniconda YAML File / Environment Management in Linux

Export Directions:
- Activate Conda Env:
$ conda activate myenv

- Choose one of the two options below:
  1. Export the Conda Env with exact dependencies / version control
   $ conda env export > environment.yml
OR
  2. Export Conda Env as a general build without strict dependencies
   $ conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

- If you want to change the environment name or dependencies, directly edit the file:
  $ nano environment.yml
    - Example of what it will look like:
      name: myenv
    channels:
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python=3.8
      - numpy
      - pandas
      - pip:
        - SomePipPackage==1.0.5



Import Directions:
- After you have exported a YAML file, navigate to the directory where you placed it.
  $ conda env create -f environment.yml
- Activate it to use:
$ conda activate environment_name
