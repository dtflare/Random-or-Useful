# Random-or-Useful
A suite of scripts, tools, and configs that are both random and useful.

# Setup
- These are not meant to be installed as a single tool or package, instead each file is it's own, standalone guide.
- The guides in this repo are focused on Cybesecurity & AI.
- The materials included are often unique processes that I've used multiple times which I believe would be useful to others.
  
# Contents:
- **Apple Device Recovery Steps** directions for wiping and reinstituting an Apple Iphone/Ipad. Works with locked devices, MDM, etc., as long as you can apply power these steps will work.
- **Binaries** directions to create binary scripts out of python/bash executables.
- **CLI-Torrents, ISO's, Bootable Drives** directions for creating a bootable USB directly in the linux terminal.
- **Custom GPT__Innovate AI** overview of my custom GPT which is publicly available in OpenAI's platform. Innovate AI is designed for people interested in learning to work with AI - whether it's creating a dataset, training a model, running evaluations, etc.
- **Github_SSH_Setup** directions to set up github SSH access in your linux terminal.
- **LS_MAGIC** a quick script I setup which extends the functionality of 'ls' in the linux terminal to display all files in a folder with the newest at the bottom (closest to the prompt), with full file-paths included.
- **Local_LLMs** directions for setting up Llamafile in your linux CLI and running local models via GGUF files found on HuggingFace. This is a great way to test out opensource models directly in your terminal (a local gradio server launches in browser), just check the RAM requirements against your OS before downloading any GGUF weights.
- **MBR to GPT Partition Change** this is an interesting way to modify predefined linux disk partitions in order to allow the device to be flashed with Windows OS firmware (try outTiny10 bloat-free Windows).
- **Miniconda_API_Setup** directions for setting up a Miniconda Python environment handler with API's activated upon Conda Env activation - securing them from being constantly in your history folders.
- **Soundclip Alias** shows how to launch a short sound clip of your choosing (Maybe Homer Simpson saying "D'oh!") and launch it by just pressing a key on your keyboard.
- **Static_IP** directions for manually setting up a static IP on a linux device.
- **Windows PSH Alias** directions for setting up aliases on your Windows computer via PowerShell. Setup a shortcut to shutdown, lock, launch a terminal, etc.
- **Windows Shortcuts** directions for creating hotkeys on a Windows device via PowerShell (use with above Windows PSH Alias).
- **YAML_files** quick directions for saving a Miniconda environment on a linux device as a .yaml file, allowing you to save/send/publish it for others to replicate and install.
