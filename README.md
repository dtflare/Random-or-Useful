# Random-or-Useful
A suite of scripts, tools, and configs that are both random and useful

# Setup
- These are not meant to be installed as a single tool or package, instead each file is it's own, standalone guide.
- The guides in this repo are focused on Cybesecurity & AI.
# Examples:
- **Local_LLMS** shows you how to run an opensource Language Model directly on your CPU from the command line which will launch a local gradio server.
- **LS_MAGIC** shows how to create an enhanced version of the bash command 'ls' in which you can list the full path of your files from newest to oldest.
- **Soundclip Alias** shows how to launch a short sound clip of your choosing (Maybe Homer Simpson saying "D'oh!") and launch it by just pressing a key on your keyboard.

### I am still working on developing the repo at large, including this README with a more detailed breakdown of everything.
